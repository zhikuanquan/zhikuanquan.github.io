## Adaptive Moment Estimation

Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) is a variant of vanilla SGD that works particularly well for
training deep neural networks with stochastic optimization. Given the default tuning variables
which work well in practice as following:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
         Hyper-parameters & Setting & Interpretation \\ \hline
         $\alpha$ & 0.001 & The step size that bounds the effective step taken in parameter space \\ \hline
         $\beta_1$ & 0.9 & To control exponential decay rates for the first moment estimates \\ \hline
         $\beta_2$ & 0.999 & To control exponential decay rates for the second moment estimates \\ \hline 
         $\epsilon$ & $10^{-8}$ & A small scalar used to prevent division by 0\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
