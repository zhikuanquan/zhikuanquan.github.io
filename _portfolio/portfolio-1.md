The presented work mainly focuses on how to establish an efficient and accurate model to distinguish between COVID-19 and healthy patients. The image data for pneumonia and healthy patients are obtained from Kaggle and they are used to train the classification model. Since Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved expert-level performance in complex visual recognition tasks, the flexible model can extract intricate patterns directly from the CT images without the need to manually define the features by doctors.
