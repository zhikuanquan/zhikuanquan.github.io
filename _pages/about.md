Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at UC Davis, specializing in causal inference and personalized medicine. My current research focuses on novel statistical methods to improve individualized healthcare outcomes with longitudinal and clustered data. I am passionate about the application of biostatistics in medicine and am actively seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in research, industry, or collaborative projects.<br/>

In this website,  I would like to share my experience about the rationale and applications of statistics and data science at [Blog Posts](https://zhikuanquan.com/year-archive/). Besides, the [Portfolio](https://zhikuanquan.com/portfolio/) contains my course projects during the study at school. In [Publications](https://zhikuanquan.com/publications/), I have uploaded my published paper. If you want to know more about me, you can download my resume at [CV](https://zhikuanquan.com/cv/).
