I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at UC Davis. I finished my undergraduate study with Statistics major in Beijing Normal University. Here is my personal website that shows my own work and study at Data Science and Statistics. <br/>

In this website,  I would like to share my experience about the rationale and applications of statistics and data science at [Blog Posts](https://zhikuanquan.com/year-archive/). Besides, the [Portfolio](https://zhikuanquan.com/portfolio/) contains my course projects during my study at school. In [Publications](https://zhikuanquan.com/publications/), I have uploaded my published paper. If you want to know more about me, you can download my resume at [CV](https://zhikuanquan.com/cv/).
